What happened on Friday?
Not a lot.

Despite much anticipation surrounding the event, only around 75 people turned up at the front gate and nobody attempted to enter.

The only person to be arrested was a man caught urinating near the entrance and a woman was detained for an undisclosed reason, Associated Press reported.

The "raid" was more of a small-scale celebration, with enthusiasts dressing up and holding placards.

"I'm a little disappointed because it's a lot less people than they said online," Nathan Brown, who drove more than 700 miles from Portland, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal newspaper.

Some local businesses have embraced Area 51's association with alien mythology
The secrecy surrounding the site has helped fuel many conspiracy theories.

What is Area 51 and what goes on there?
Most famous is the claim that the site hosts an alien spacecraft and the bodies of its pilots after they crashed at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The US government says there were no aliens and the crashed craft was a weather balloon.

Others claim to have seen UFOs above or near the site, while some say they have been abducted by aliens, and even experimented on, before being returned to Earth.
